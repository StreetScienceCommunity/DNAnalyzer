   question: 
      text: "What is the proper definition of evolution?"

   items:
    - choice: changes in a population of organisms over a period of time
      correct: true
    - choice: changes in individual organisms during their lifetime
      correct: false
    - choice: organisms coming into existence at a defined moment in time and not changing
      correct: false
   hint: |
      Even though evolution is taking place all around us, for many species the process operates so slowly that it is not observable except over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, much too long to witness in a human lifetime.

   question: 
      text: "What is the biological reason for survival benefits (like beaks belonging to birds, lizards' ability to change a color)?"
   items:
    - choice: mutation
      correct: true
    - choice: genetic disease
      correct: false
    - choice: environmental changes
      correct: false
   hint: |
      Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason. 
   followup: 
      text: "Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time."

   items:
    - choice: Malthus
      correct: false
    - choice: Darwin
      correct: false
    - choice: Lamarck
      correct: true
   hint: |
      Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.On the other hand, Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.

      text: "The Lamarck's idea about organisms gaining some abilities if they need them and losing others if they don't need them is applicable here."

   question: 
      text: "How did Lamarck's theory of evolution differ from Darwin's?"
   items:
    - choice: Lamarck believed that Earth was old enough to provide a sufficient time scale for the process of evolution.
      correct: false
    - choice: Lamarck believed that characteristics acquired during an organism’s lifetime could be passed on to the next generation.
      correct: true
    - choice: Lamarck believed that the environment played a significant role.
      correct: false
   hint: |
      Darwin thought, that environment performs the cruel but immensely important task of selecting the fittest organisms. 
   followup: 
      text: "For Lamarck, the environment governs adaptive change by inheritance of acquired traits, while in Darwin thought, it performs the cruel but immensely important task of selecting the fittest organisms."

    - choice: It is where the fittest die out and therefore can't reproduce and pass on their genes

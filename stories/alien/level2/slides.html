???
- On this planet Earth there are different materials, creatures and forms of life on the earth's surface. 
- Everything that can be found on the earth's surface seems to be connected in one way or the other. 
- Soil, water, air, plants, animals and humans are parts of it.
- I find life in all kinds of forms and it seems to me that organisms are different. 
- But where do these differences come from?
- Why are do small and big organisms exist?
- And what makes all these big and tiny organisms different? 
- I find the answer in the thought that to survive, an organism or animal must adapt well to its environment. 
- If an animal eats insects, they must hunt for them. 
- Their body must have tools for this, such as a beak. 
- Other creatures, such as lizards, have a greenish and brownish body color in order to avoid falling prey to predators.
- Therefore, diverse creatures have different colors and shapes.

???
- These differences are probably a matter of trial and error, and the winners are those who survive long enough to produce offspring. 
- And their offspring will also go through the same trial and error process.
- It could only take one generation with one mutation, which provides some survival benefits, in order to make the leap that will ensure the existence of this animal in the population.

???
- There are two popular theories about evolution - Lamarck’s and Darwin’s.
- Their theories are different because Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.
- On the other hand, Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.
- For example, let’s consider a giraffe's long neck.
- Why is this neck so long?
- Lamarck's theory suggested that the giraffe's original short-necked ancestor repeatedly stretched its neck to reach the higher branches to eat.

<small><small>[http://www.vce.bioninja.com.au/aos-4-change-over-time/evolution/evolutionary-theories.html]</small></small>

???
- Darwin's theory suggests that a giraffe was born with a longer neck by random chance. 
- Long necked and short necked giraffes once existed together, but the long-necked giraffe had an adaptive advantage.
- Having access to more food allowed the giraffe to live longer and reproduce more, ultimately leading to more long-neck giraffes.

???
- Now I understand why all life on earth is related. 
- In other words, if I could travel back in time, I could find a common genetic ancestor for any two organisms on earth. 
- It does not matter how different they seem. 
- Even humans and bananas, which humans eat for breakfast, share a distant ancestor. 
- It may seem shocking. 
- But when comparing a human genome to a banana genome, there are so many genes that are similar within the two organisms. 
- Although, from the outside they appear to be very different organisms. 
- Thinking about what humans do for living and what a banana does, there's a lot of things they do in the same way. 
- A lot of genes are just fundamental to life.
- Since I already learned this, it is not so shocking for me that humans and bananas share the same ancestor.

### Introduction to the biology

![The image of the tree of life is still in the drawing process](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
- An ancestor carries genetic information that is still shared by all of its descendants. 
- A way to showcase relationships of different species to each other is called a phylogenetic tree. 
- These trees can depict hypothetical relationships and traits of organisms, genes, or even proteins. 
- A specific form trying to showcase all living organisms is the tree of life.
- At the base of the tree trunk lies that ancestor, the first living organism on this planet. 
- Through the evolution of life over the last 3.8 billion years, new species have emerged, resulting in entire lineages of organisms.
- Every branching point in that tree is a story of remarkable adaptation to an ever-changing world.
- The goal of the tree of life is: try to understand how every species is related to each other. 
- Isn't it fascinating!

### Introduction to the biology

![The three-domains tree with bacteria, archaea, eukarya domains.](images/domains0.png)

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)#/media/File:Two_domain_tree.png]</small></small>

???
- Now I see that how the tree of life is structured. 
- Based on the first branches of the tree of life I can see that creatures belong to three domains. 
- Domains are a concept of grouping creatures. 
- The three domains are called Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. 
- All domains have DNA as a blueprint of life.
- “Domains” are the top-level classification which categorizes life in the most general way. 
- For example, one difference between the domains is if the DNA is stored in a compartment called nucleus or it just lies in a circular form within the cell.
- Eukaryotes, the cell type of the Eukarya domain creatures, have a nucleus. 
- Apart from nucleus, there are other differences between organisms from diverse domains.
- But back to the nucleus.
- The nucleus is part of a cell.
- OK.
- But what is a cell?

### Introduction to the biology

![The cell as the building block of all organisms. The main elements of the cell are nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plasma membrane](images/cell.png)

???
- Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. 
- It is the smallest unit that can live on its own and it makes up all living organisms. 
- A eukaryotic cell has three main parts: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. 
- The cell membrane surrounds the cell and controls the substances that go into and out of the cell. 
- The liquid inside the cell is called cytoplasm. 
- Different compartments of the cell are surrounded by this cytoplasm.
- One of these compartments is the nucleus.
- The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is also enclosed with a nuclear membrane, and it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material.

<small><small>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWjYS-DNIiQ]</small></small>

???
- But the cell types of the domains are all a bit different. 
- I find out that archaea were first classified as bacterias.
- Their appearance from the outside, so their cell type, looks closer to bacterias.
- However other properties are closer to the once of eukaryota.
- Therefore, archaea form a separate domain from bacteria. 
- I find bacteria as prokaryotic organisms most fascinating out of all 3 domains. 
- They are also the smallest creatures on their planet, like I am mine.

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)#/media/File:Celltypes.svg]</small></small>

???
- Now it is time for me to learn more about cells types of different organisms.
- Cells are of two types: eukaryotic, which for example contain their genetic information enclosed by a membrane called a nucleus.
- Whereas prokaryotic do not have their genetic information enclosed. 
- Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular. 
- Moreover, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles and the cell size is from 10 to 100 micrometres, whereas prokaryotic cell size is smaller - from 0.1 to 5 micrometres.
- Wow, if they are so small how can I look at them?

### Introduction to the biology
![Loupe over the globe. Various microorganisms are visible in the magnifying glass of the loupe.](images/earth_under_loupe.png)

???
- Let's see.
- I am equipped with a special zoom view tool, which is a very useful tool to investigate the diversity of life. 
- My zoom tool works in the same way as a microscope.

### Introduction to the biology

![Sam is holding a control panel, on which there are 3 buttons - an eye, the letter L, the letter E. The letter L corresponds to the light microscope, which is schematically depicted next to the L button.The letter E corresponds to the electron microscope, which is shown next to the E button.](images/sam_and_microscopes.png)

???
- Unlike terrestrial microscopes, my zoom view tool has three settings in one. 
- The first option allows me to see objects which humans can see with their naked eye. 
- The second setting turns on a light microscope-like vision. 
- The light microscope uses lenses and light, so a normal human eye can see something very small in more detail.
- Finally, the third setting makes me able to see objects available for viewing under a terrestrial electron microscope. 
- For objects that are not even visible with a light microscope, an electron microscope can help humans to look at very tiny objects.

### Introduction to the biology

![Logarithmic scale of relative sizes from 0.1 nm to 1 m. The interval from 0.1 to 100 μm corresponds to an electron microscope; an atom, lipids, protein, flu virus, mitochondria, bacteria, plant cell, and animal cell fall into this interval. The section from 10 nm to 10 mm corresponds to a light microscope, this interval includes mitochondria, bacteria, plant cell, animal cell, human egg, and frogs egg. The interval from 100 μm to 1 m corresponds to a naked eye; human egg, frogs egg, chicken egg, ostrich egg, and adult female fall into this interval.](images/micriscope-sizes.png)

???
- Light microscopes let us look at objects that are between a millimetre (10-3 m) and  0.2 micrometres (0.2 thousands of a millimetre or 2 x 10-7 m) in size. 
- Whereas, the most powerful electron microscopes allow us to see objects as small as an atom (about one ten-millionth of a millimetre or 1 angstrom or 10-10 m).

![The leaf is on the microscope](images/microscope_leaf.png)

???
- For example, if you are curious what a leaf is made from, the best would be to use a light microscope. 

---

### Introduction to the biology

![The leaf is on the microscope, a zoom from one point on the leaf shows a plant cell](images/microscope_leaf_extended.png)

???
- That is because the cell of a plant is in size between 10 and 100 micrometres. 
- However, if you want to go further to investigate this leaf’s proteins or even atoms which size starting from 1 nanometre, then an electron microscope should be used.

???
- Looking at life through these microscope-like visions, I am surprised! 
- It turned out, there are different tiny organisms of different colors, sizes, and shapes.

???
- These organisms are around 1 micrometer in size. 
- They are only visible under a microscope or my microscope-like tool. 
- Thus, they are called microscopic organisms, microbes, or microorganisms.

### Introduction to the biology

![The image of the tree of life is still in the drawing process](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
- At this point I already have so many questions from what I have learnt.
- How can one find out where an organism belongs in the tree of life? 
- How is such a tree built? 
- And what is one common thing called DNA in all creatures on earth?
- How does it look like and work? 
- Let’s explore it with me.

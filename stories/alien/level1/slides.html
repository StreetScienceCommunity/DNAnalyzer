---

### Introduction
![earth](images/earth.png)

???
-Until he suddenly discovered the Earth. 
-It was very special because it was blue and green, Sam’s favourite colors. 
-He decided to approach and explore the Earth. 
-As he got closer he discovered water and land. 

---

### Introduction


![environment](images/earth-environment.png)

???
-Looking closer he saw forests, mountains, rivers and animals. 
-They all look very interesting. 
-But since he was the smallest creature on his planet he wondered how small organisms on earth can be. 

---

### Introduction

### Introduction to the biology

![http://www.lifesabundance.com/thumbnails/BigLittleDogs.jpg](images/dogs.png)

???
-On this planet Sam saw the Earth and understood that there are different materials, creatures and forms of life on the earth's surface. 
-Everything that can be found on the earth's surface is connected or interacting in one way or the other. 
-Soil, water, air, plants, animals and humans are parts of it.
-Sam saw that organisms are different. 
-Sam wondered why there are small and big organisms, what makes all these big and tiny organisms so different. 
-At the same time, these organisms have bodies different in shape. 
-Why?
-The answer is: to survive, an animal must adapt well to its environment. 
-If an animal eats insects, they must hunt for them. 
-Their body must have tools for this, such as a beak. 
-Other creatures, such as lizards, have a greenish and brownish body color in order to avoid falling prey to predators.
-Therefore, diverse creatures have different colors and shapes.

???
-These differences are probably a matter of trial and error, and the winners are those who survive long enough to produce offspring. 
-And their offspring will also go through the same trial and error process.
-It could only take one generation with one mutation, which provides some survival benefits, in order to make the leap that will ensure the existence of this animal in the population.

### Introduction to the biology

![https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13plgk/til_human_dna_is_50_the_same_as_bananas/](images/human-banana.png)

???
-All life on earth is related. 
-In other words, if Sam could travel back in time, he could find a common genetic ancestor for any two organisms on earth. 
-It does not matter how different they seem. 
-Even humans and bananas, which humans eat for breakfast, share a distant ancestor. 
-It may seem shocking. 
-But when comparing a human genome to a banana genome, there are so many genes that are similar in these two, from the outside very different organisms. 
-Thinking about what humans do for living and what a banana does, there's a lot of things they do in the same way, like consuming oxygen. 
-A lot of those genes are just fundamental to life.
-Since Sam already learned this, it was not so shocking for him that humans and bananas share the same ancestor.

---

### Introduction to the biology

![Tree of life drawing](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
-An ancestor carries genetic information that is still shared by all creatures on earth. 
-A way to showcase relationships of different species to each other is called a phylogenetic tree. 
-These trees can depict hypothetical relationships and traits of organisms, genes, or even proteins. 
-A specific form trying to showcase all living organisms is the tree of life.

![Tree of life drawing](images/tree-of-life.png)
-Nice game here.




???
-Sam found diverse creatures. 
-He started to investigate where these creatures are in the tree of life. 
-Based on their different characteristics Sam adds creatures into a tree.
-If you would like to join Sam to learn more about the tree of life you can find a nice and helpful game via the link. 

---

### Introduction to the biology

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)#/media/File:Two_domain_tree.png](images/domains.png)

???
-Sam saw that the tree of life can be structured. 
-Sam figured out that creatures belong to various domains in the tree of life. 
-Domains are a concept of grouping creatures. 
-Prokaryotic organisms belong either to the domain Archaea or the domain Bacteria; organisms with eukaryotic cells belong to the domain Eukarya. 
-All domains have DNA as a blueprint of life.
-“Domains” are the top-level classification which categorizes life in the most general way. For example, one difference between the domains is if -the DNA is stored in a compartment called nucleus or it just lies in a circular form within the cell.
Eukaryotes have a nucleus. 
-Apart from nucleus, there are other differences between organisms from diverse domains.
-Sam wondered what this nucleus belongs to and learnt that a nucleus is usually the part of a cell.

---

### Introduction to the biology

![Figure from lecture “Introduction of Big Data in Life Science”](images/cell.png)

???
-Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. 
-It is the smallest unit that can live on its own and that makes up all living organisms. 
-A eukaryotic cell has three main parts: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. 
-The cell membrane surrounds the cell and controls the substances that go into and out of the cell. 
-The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is also enclosed with a nuclear membrane, and it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material.

---

### Introduction to the biology

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWjYS-DNIiQ](images/domains2.png)

???
-Sam found a cell wonderful and went back to “domains”.
-Bacteria are organisms that form a domain of organisms diverse in shape, size, structure, and even habitats. 
-Archaea form a separate domain from bacteria. 
-Nevertheless, Sam did not investigate archaea further because this is a different but also fascinating story. 
-Instead, he focused on bacteria as prokaryotic organisms. 

---

### Introduction to the biology
![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)#/media/File:Celltypes.svg](images/eukaryote-prokaryote-cell.png)

???
-Now it is time for Sam to learn more about cells of organisms from different domains.
-Cells are of two types: eukaryotic, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic, which do not. 
-Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular. 
-Moreover, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles and the cell size is from 10 to 100 micrometres, whereas prokaryotic cell size is smaller - from 0.1 to 5 micrometres.
-Wow, if they are so small how can Sam look at them?
---

### Introduction to the biology
![earth_under_loupe](images/earth_under_loupe.png)

???
-As Sam was so small on its planet, he was particularly interested in discovering small things on earth. 
-Since Sam was equipped with a special zoom view tool, he decided to use this tool to investigate the diversity of life. 
-Sam's zoom tool works in the same way as a microscope. 

---

### Introduction to the biology

![sam_and_microscopes](images/sam_and_microscopes.png)

???
-Unlike terrestrial microscopes, Sam’s zoom view tool has three settings in one. 
-The first option allows Sam to see objects which humans can see with their naked eye. 
-The second setting turns on a light microscope-like vision. 
-Finally, the third setting makes Sam able to see objects available for viewing under a terrestrial electron microscope.

---

### Introduction to the biology

![https://training.galaxyproject.org/](images/micriscope-sizes.png)

???
-Light microscopes let us look at objects that are between a millimetre (10-3 m) and  0.2 micrometres (0.2 thousands of a millimetre or 2 x 10-7 m) in size. 
-Whereas, the most powerful electron microscopes allow us to see objects as small as an atom (about one ten-millionth of a millimetre or 1 angstrom or 10-10 m)

---

### Introduction to the biology

![microscope_leaf](images/microscope_leaf.png)

???
-For example, if you are curious what a leaf is made from, the best would be to use a light microscope. 

---

### Introduction to the biology

![microscope_leaf_extended](images/microscope_leaf_extended.png)

???
-That is because the cell of a plant is in size between 10 and 100 micrometres. 
-However, if you want to go further to investigate this leaf’s proteins or even atoms which size starting from 1 nanometre, then an electron microscope should be used.

### Introduction to the biology

![https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/lab-report/microbiome-mashup-scientists-align-to-understand-microbes-and-around-us](images/loupe-microbes2.png)

???
-Looking at life through these microscope-like visions, Sam was surprised! It turned out, there are different tiny organisms of different colors, sizes, and shapes.

---

### Introduction to the biology


![https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/2018-small-world-in-motion-competition](images/microorganisms.png)

???
-These organisms are around 1 micrometer in size. 
-They are only visible under a microscope or Sam’s microscope-like tool. 
-Thus, they are called microscopic organisms, microbes, or microorganisms.

---

### Introduction to the biology

![Tree of life drawing](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
-At this point Sam already has so many questions from what he has learnt.
-Sam asks himself how can one find out where an organism belongs in the tree of life? 
-How is such a tree built? 
-And if there is one common thing called DNA in all creatures on earth, what does this thing look like and work? 
-Let’s explore it with Sam.

---

### DNA

![https://nebula.org/blog/de/dna-desoxyribonukleinsaeure/](images/dna1.png)

???
-DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. 
-DNA is the material that carries all the information about how an organism will look and function. 
-For instance, DNA determines such things as color and shape of an organism and how this organism breathes. 
-All such information is encoded in DNA. 
-Each piece of information is carried on a different section of the DNA. 
-These sections are called genes.

---

### DNA

![https://www.yourgenome.org/video/from-dna-to-protein-flash](images/chromosome.png)

???
-After learning that DNA exists, Sam was eager to see this magical thing which carries all the information describing living organisms. 
-Since he already knew how tiny it was, he used his electron microscope vision. The most exciting thing he found in eukaryotic organisms. 
-It turned out that DNA in eukaryotes is found in structures of the cell called chromosomes. 
-Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of cells. 
-Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

---

### DNA

![https://www.clinicalomics.com/topics/translational-research/natural-suppressor-mutations-may-help-protect-us-from-genetic-disorders/](images/dna-with-mutation.png)

???
-DNA is the blueprint of life, because by reading and copying the DNA first RNA and then proteins are formed.
-Proteins are little ‘work horses’, which the cells need for carrying out its function. 
-DNA also allows living organisms to reproduce. 
-The genes in DNA transmit physical characteristics from parents to their heirs.
-DNA is a chain of chemical units found in each cell of a living creature. 
-The chemical units are arranged in a particular sequence. 
-This sequence forms a code, called a genetic code, that tells cells what to do. 
-Sometimes changes with one unit of the DNA can happen. 
-This is called a mutation. 
-Some of the mutations can have no consequences at all but others can cause diseases and other problems. 
-Mutations are also very important for evolution. 
-A mutation could lead to a better adjustment to a certain condition, like hot weather.

### DNA

![https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/312648399128435797/](images/dna-builders.png)

???
-Sam began to learn about the structure of DNA and saw it is complex.
-It is composed of chemicals that are linked together like a chain. 
-Each piece of DNA has two long strands, or chains. 
-The two strands are connected together. 
-They form a shape like a ladder that has been twisted into a spiral.
-Chemicals called phosphates and sugars make up the sides of the ladder, the so-called back bone. 
-There are other  chemical compounds called bases, which bind together, like steps in a ladder.
-Each base on one strand is joined to a base on the other strand. 
-The linked bases form the rungs of the ladder.

### DNA

![https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/base-editing-now-able-to-convert-adenine-thymine-to-guanine-cytosine-30706](images/nucleotides.png)

???
-Sam was able to see four different bases in DNA: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. 
-These chemicals are called nucleotides and they are repeated in different orders over and over again in each strand of DNA. 
-The order in which the bases are arranged is very important. 
-It forms a code that tells cells to make certain kinds of proteins. 
-The differences in these proteins is what makes different living creatures—such as a yeast, a mouse, or two different people.

### Sequencing

![https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/107664247327936161/](images/dna-tetris.png)

???
-In Sam's mind, he wondered: can it be determined in which order the nucleotides occur in every type of organism? 
-When you have a small piece of material from a specific organism, can you identify this order?

---

### Sequencing

![https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/10485011602449279/](images/sequencing1.png)

???
-After some research, he realized that a technique for determining this order already exists. 
-This technique is called DNA sequencing.

---

### Sequencing

![https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/88453580171419743/](images/dna-4-hands.png)
???
-DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of nucleotides in DNA. 
-It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine.

---

### Sequencing

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger](images/sanger.png)

???
-The first person who determined the sequence was Frederick Sanger. 
-In the 50’s he determined the sequence of amino acids in a protein. 
-He showed  the order of the 51 amino acids (the small building blocks of proteins which help organisms to perform different functions) of the insulin protein, which was never done before.

---

### Sequencing

![https://singularityhub.com/2019/02/01/how-genome-sequencing-and-senolytics-can-help-us-live-healthier-longer/](images/sander-method.png)

???
-A bit later, in the early 70’s Sanger developed a method to determine the exact sequence of nucleotides within a gene. 
-This method is called the “chain termination” method. 
-In the same year, another chemical method of DNA sequencing was explained by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert. 
-The “chain termination” method is still used in laboratories today for smaller stretches of sequences.
-However, nowadays there are cheaper and less time consuming methods.

---

### Sequencing

![Figure from lecture “Introduction of Big Data in Life Science](images/sequencing-timeline.png)

???
-This timeline of the development of sequencing was found by Sam after searching for more information about it.
-The Sanger method is tedious and time-consuming. 
-Other methods were developed afterwards such as Illumina sequencing, the so-called second-generation method and later around 2014 nanopore-based DNA sequencing, the so-called third generation sequencing.

---

### Sequencing

![https://www.genengnews.com/gen-edge/nanopore-sequencing-the-long-and-winding-road/](images/nanopore.png)

???
-Nanopore sequencing is one of the latest methods of DNA sequencing.
-It was developed by Oxford Nanopore and represents a new generation of high throughput  sequencing technology. 
-It measures the change in voltage when the DNA is transported across a membrane through a tiny pore. 
-In this picture there are few components: membrane depicted in gray, nanopore in blue, motor-protein in purple, and the DNA strand in light blue.
-A membrane has a simple structure in which proteins can be incorporated.
-The incorporated protein is called nanopore.
-There is a small hole inside this nanopore the size of a nanometer (hence the name nanopore), such that a DNA strand can pass through this hole.
-The basic idea of nanopore sequencing is that in the channel of nanopore there is not so much space.
-Therefore, how much exactly the DNA blocks this channel depends on the nucleotide sequence.

---

### Sequencing

![https://streetscience.community/protocols/beer-dna-sequencing/#sequencing](images/nanopore-seq-process.png)

???
-In this picture we can see the scheme of nanopore sequencing.
-Sam decided to participate in this process in order to learn more about how it works.
-As Sam is a tiny guy it was not a problem.

---

### Sequencing
![Sam_on_DNA](images/Sam_on_DNA.png)

???
-Sam hooked on DNA. 
---

### Sequencing
![Sam_on_motor](images/Sam_on_motor.png)

???
-When the DNA binded to a motor protein, Sam jumped to a motor protein.
-The motor protein is used to move DNA forward. 
-In other words, it is an engine which reduces the speed of DNA passing through nanopore.
-It is important to slow down the DNA strand because, otherwise, the electrical signal would be distorted by combining signals of several nucleotides.
-Sitting on the motor protein Sam started his wonderful journey while the motor protein looked for a nanopore.
-The motor protein was fixed to the nanopore and then opened the double strand DNA, directing one strand through the nanopore in which bases are read one by one. 
---

### Sequencing

![Sam_inside_nanopore](images/Sam_inside_nanopore.png)

???
-Sam jumped to the DNA strand because he was curious what was happening with this moving strand.
-When it passed through, the tension on this pore was changed.
-The change in this voltage was specific for each of the four nucleobases and for Sam, whereby the sequence can be recognized.

---

### Sequencing

![Figure from lecture “Introduction of Big Data in Life Science](images/nanopore-device.png)

???
-A special feature of the offered Nanopore devices is their size. 
-Most of these devices are the size of a Mars bar and can also be connected directly to a computer. 
-In this picture there is a portable real-time device for sequencing called MinION connected to a computer for direct transfer of sequencing data for further analysis.
-Sample preparation can be simplified so that sequencing can also take place outside of a laboratory.

### Alignment

![https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/439663982367597812/](images/alignment1.png)

???
-Thanks to nanopore sequencing, Sam received the unique sequence of DNA.
-But what is next to do with this sequence? 
-How to determine the specific organism this DNA belongs to?

---

### Alignment/Mapping

![https://marlenechism.com/blog/powerful-forces-intention-alignment/](images/alignment2.png)

???
-The answer is to compare this sequence with the so-called reference sequence. 
-It is the sequence which serves as a template. 

---

### Alignment

![https://towardsdatascience.com/pairwise-sequence-alignment-using-biopython-d1a9d0ba861f](images/paiwise-alignment.png)

???
-Sam can compare sequences by alignment. 
-Sequence alignment is an arrangement of two or more sequences, highlighting their similarity.
-Comparing the sequences it could be that one of the sequences has a different nucleotide in one position. This is called a Mismatch like the C to T in the red box.
-It could also happen that there is no nucleotide in the second sequence to the one in the first like the G in the blue box. This is called a gap.
-Mismatches in the alignment correspond to mutations, and gaps correspond to insertions or deletions. 
---

### Alignment

![https://medium.com/@hasini.dbv/pairwise-sequence-alignment-global-and-local-alignments-5ebacf83c752](images/multiple-alignment.png)

???
-Alignment is an important instrument for finding a similarity between two or more sequences
-Due to its semi-conservative duplication mechanism, DNA transmits genetic information from generation to generation. 
-Changes in the material are sometimes caused by errors or mutations in duplication, or by viruses and other mechanisms that move sequences between individuals and within chromosomes. 
-Alignment between sequences indicates that both sequences originated from a common ancestor that contained the matching subsequences. 
-In the case of genetic sequences, it implies that their carriers evolved from a common ancestor.

???
-Now Sam knows enough to work with samples of different creatures. 
-Since he is on earth, he can collect a variety of samples and analyze them. 
-Nevertheless, they are all inextricably linked to their surroundings. 
-A clear sample of one organism is impossible to obtain. 
-There is a solution in metagenomics. 
-The metagenomics is the type of genetic analyses focused on DNA samples extracted from the environment.

---

### Metagenomics

![https://sciwri.club/archives/7530](images/metagenomics2.png)

???
-There are several steps in the metagenomics process, including collecting samples, DNA sequencing, assembly, classifying, annotation, and analysis.
-As you can see in the picture, It is possible to collect samples from different environments - soil, water, human gut, and even from another planet, such as Sam's planet.
-The samples are sent to a laboratory for DNA extraction and sequencing.
-As soon as sequence is obtained this data can be processed using various technical tools in order to assemble, classify and annotate them, and analyze them afterwards.

---

### Metagenomics

![https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/feature-story/whats-a-microbiome](images/metagenomics3.png)

???
-To begin with, soil, air, water, parts of living organisms, and other places can be used as sources of samples.
-Once samples are collected, the second step is DNA sequencing. In this step, short DNA reads can be obtained.

---

### Metagenomics

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly](images/contigs.png)

???
-The third step is assembly, in which short reads are made longer by using different assembly algorithms. 
-This longer sequence is called “contigs”.

---

### Metagenomics

![https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2019/recovering-rep-genomes-from-mgs.html](images/binning.png)

???
-Classifying (or binning) is the fourth step. 
-Each contig can be assigned to the most appropriate genome.
-At the fifth step, annotation, the previous step's data will be used to annotate the data.
-Genes can be predicted. 
-Species can be identified.

---

### Metagenomics

![https://streetscience.community/protocols/beer-data-analysis/](images/graph.png)

???
-The last but not least step is analysis. 
-The experts use different tools to analyze data and draw conclusions to answer their research questions.

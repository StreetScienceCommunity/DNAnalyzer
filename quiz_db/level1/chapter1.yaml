- title: What is the proper definition of evolution?
  description:
  type: choose one
  hint: Even though evolution is taking place all around us, for many species the process operates so slowly that it is not observable except over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, much too long to witness in a human lifetime.
  explanation: Evolution is a change in a population of organisms through time leading to the appearance of new forms

  correct: 1

- title: What are biological survival benefits for a population?
  description:
  type: choose one
  hint: Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason. 
  explanation: Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. Therefore, mutations can be bad for the individual but overall beneficial for a population. Niche properties like the color changing of lizards can be crucial for there survival. They are not as easy to find by animals who would like to eat them and therefore can survive longer than other species.

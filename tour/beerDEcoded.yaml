    content: >-
      Beer contains DNA that comes from its ingredients and some hundred microbes. There are 1,000+ yeasts used for brewing and 200+ hop varieties, each one bearing a different DNA and contributing to differentiate its properties.<br>
      Thanks to sequencing it is now easier to find the different genomes contained in a beer sample and investigate their characteristics. The sequencing of the full genome of 157 brewing yeast strains was, for example, recently reported (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27610566/">Gallone B, Steensels J, Prahl T, et al. 2016</a>).<br>

  - title: <b>[INFO]</b> The effect of microbiom on beer
    content: >-      
      Based on the identification of strains present in beer with desired characteristics, controlled experiments in which the microbial composition of the brew is altered could allow us to investigate if the presence of specific microorganisms affects flavour. The origin of each yeast species can be investigated; i.e. whether they come with the ingredients or from the environment at the production site. Furthermore, plant DNA, such as malt and hop varieties, can be found in beer samples, and the bacterial diversity can be mapped.

  - title: <b>[INFO]</b> How to study the microbiome of beer
    content: >-
      To study the microbiome of beer you need to find out what is inside the beer. Getting this inside can be found by extracting the DNAs of the living organisms (yeast) inside the beer. Now you would also like to 'read' this DNA. This can be achieved by sequencing the DNA.<br>Having these sequences now enables us to do a Data analysis, which we will do in the following.

  - title: <b>[INFO]</b> Workflow of BeerDEcoded process
    content: >-
      The beerDeCoded process contains 3 consistent steps. The first step is DNA extraction from beer. Then, this DNA can be sequenced. That means that we can obtain the sequence of nucleotides for this specific DNA. Finally, we have to analyze received data in order to know which organisms this DNA is from.<br><img src="workflow-of-beerDeCoded.png" alt="workflow of beerDeCoded process" width="400" height="400">

  - title: <b>[INFO]</b> Key step in metagenomic data analysis
    content: >-
      One of the key steps in metagenomic data analysis is to identify the taxon to which the individual read belongs. Taxonomic classification tools are using microbial genome databases to identify the origin of each sequence.<br>
    backdrop: true
  - title: <b>[INFO]</b> Process of taxonomic classification with Kraken2
    content: >-
      To perform the taxonomic classification we will use Kraken2. This tool uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer">k-mers</a> (the read’s subsequences of length k) to assign a taxonomic label to the sequence (if possible).<br>The taxonomic label is assigned based on matches of k-mer content of the considering sequence to the k-mer content of reference genome sequence. The result is a classification of the considering sequence to the most likely taxonomic label. If the k-mer content is not similar to any genomic sequence in the database used, it will not assign any taxonomic label.<br>

      Have a look at the tool's parameters of the <b>'Kraken2'</b> tool.<br><br>
      <small>Additional info:<br><b>Parameter ‘Single or paired reads’</b><br>Single-end reads are the fragments sequenced from one side. With paired-end sequencing, the fragments are sequenced from both sides. This approach results in two reads per fragment, with the first read in forward orientation and the second read in reverse-complement orientation. With this technique, we have the advantage to get more information about each DNA fragment compared to reads sequenced by only single-end sequencing<br><b>Parameter ‘Confidence'</b><br>A confidence score of 0.0 means that non-restrictive taxonomic assignation is desired. This value can be increased if a more restrictive taxonomic assignation is desired. For example, a confidence score of 0.1 means that at least 10% of the k-mers should match entries in the database. <br><b>Parameter ‘Select a Kraken2 database’</b><br>We need to identify the taxon to which the individual reads belong. To identify the origin of each sequence, taxonomic classification tools use  microbial genome databases. For this tutorial, we will use the <i>fungi2019-03</i> database.</small><br>

      <small>Additional info (<a href="https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#output-formats">from Kraken Manual</a>):<br>
      In <b>classification file</b> each sequence (or sequence pair, in the case of paired reads) classified by Kraken 2 results in a single line of output. Kraken 2's output lines contain five tab-delimited fields; from left to right, they are:
      <ol><li>"C"/"U": a one letter code indicating that the sequence was either classified or unclassified.</li><li>The sequence ID, obtained from the FASTA/FASTQ header.</li><li>The taxonomy ID Kraken 2 used to label the sequence; this is 0 if the sequence is unclassified.</li><li>The length of the sequence in bp. In the case of paired read data, this will be a string containing the lengths of the two sequences in bp, separated by a pipe character, e.g. "98|94".</li><li>A space-delimited list indicating the LCA mapping of each k-mer in the sequence(s). For example, "562:13 561:4 A:31 0:1 562:3" would indicate that:<br><ul><li>the first 13 k-mers mapped to taxonomy ID #562</li><li>the next 4 k-mers mapped to taxonomy ID #561</li><li>the next 31 k-mers contained an ambiguous nucleotide</li><li>the next k-mer was not in the database</li><li>the last 3 k-mers mapped to taxonomy ID #562</li></ul>Note that paired read data will contain a "|:|" token in this list to indicate the end of one read and the beginning of another.When Kraken 2 is run against a protein database (see [Translated Search]), the LCA hitlist will contain the results of querying all six frames of each sequence. Reading frame data is separated by a "-:-" token.</li></ol>
      Kraken 2's standard sample <b>report file</b> format is tab-delimited with one line per taxon. The fields of the output, from left-to-right, are as follows:<ol><li>Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon</li><li>Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon</li><li>Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon</li><li>A rank code, indicating (U)nclassified, (R)oot, (D)omain, (K)ingdom, (P)hylum, (C)lass, (O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, or (S)pecies. Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with a number indicating the distance from that rank. E.g., "G2" is a rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.</li><li>NCBI taxonomic ID number</li><li>Indented scientific name</li></ol>The scientific names are indented using space, according to the tree structure specified by the taxonomy.</small>

- Hello, I am an alien from the planet Gigantic. 
- My planet is very big and colorful. 
- But sometimes I feel a bit alone. 
- I am the smallest creature on planet Gigantic.
- At least it feels like I am.
- Sometimes I wonder what is out there in this unknown of the universe.
- Are there even smaller creatures than me.

- Looking closer I see forests, mountains, rivers and animals.

questions:

# 1
- title: How is the research area called where environmental samples are analyzed for genetic diversity?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Biology is a branch of science that deals with living organisms and their vital processes. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines general biology, molecular biology, cybernetics, genetics, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and statistics. Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of biology focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes.

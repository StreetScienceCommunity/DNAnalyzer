questions:

# 1
- title: We have the following alignment. What is colored by red?
  type: choose_one
  hint: A match means the nucleotides are the same in both sequences. 
  explanation: Comparing the sequences it could be that one of the sequences has a different nucleotide in one position. This is called a mismatch like the C to T in the red box. Mismatches in the alignment correspond to mutations.

  point: 3
  choices:
    - 1: match
      correct: false
    - 2: coincidence
      correct: false
    - 3: mismatch
      correct: true
    - 4: overlap
      correct: false
    - 5: gap
      correct: false

# 2
- title: We have the following alignment. What is colored by green?
  type: choose_one
  hint: Is there a difference between the two green-colored nucleotides?
  explanation: If the nucleotide is the same in the first and second sequences it is called a match, here indicated by the green color.

# 3
- title: We have the following alignment. What is colored by blue?
  type: choose_one
  hint: A insertion or deletion means that over time a new nucleotide is added or is missing in the DNA sequence. 
  explanation: Comparing the sequences it could be that one of the sequences has a different nucleotide in one position. It could also happen that there is no nucleotide in the second sequence to the one in the first like the G in the blue box. This is called a gap. Mismatches in the alignment correspond to mutations, and gaps correspond to insertions or deletions.

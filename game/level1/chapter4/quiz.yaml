questions:

# 1
- title: We have the following alignment. What is colored by red?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Comparing the sequences it could be that one of the sequences has a different nucleotide in one position. This is called a Mismatch like the C to T in the red box. It could also happen that there is no nucleotide in the second sequence to the one in the first like the G in the blue box. This is called a gap. Mismatches in the alignment correspond to mutations, and gaps correspond to insertions or deletions.

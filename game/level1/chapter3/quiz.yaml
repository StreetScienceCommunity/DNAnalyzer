# 1
- title: What is the other name of Sanger sequencing?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Sanger DNA sequencing is also known as the chain-termination method of sequencing. The Sanger technique uses dideoxynucleotides or ddNTPs in addition to typical deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) in the reaction. ddNTPs result in termination of the DNA strand because ddNTPs lack the 3’-OH group required for phosphodiester bond formation between nucleotides. Without this bond, the chain of nucleotides being formed is terminated.

# 4
- title: Nanopore sequencing method was developed by
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Chain termination method was developed by Sanger, that is why it is also called Sanger sequencing method. In the same year, another chemical method of DNA sequencing was explained by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert. In 2014 the company Oxford Nanopore released its first portable nanopore sequencing device.

  point: 6
  choices:
    - 1: use nanopore sequencing device MinION as it’s the fastest method and the device is portable to take it to France
      correct: false
    - 2: it doesn't matter if the cheese would be overripe as the DNA would remain the same
      correct: true
    - 2: use any method of sequencing
      correct: true

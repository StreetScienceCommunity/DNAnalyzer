# 1
- title: Where can you find DNA in a eukaryotic cell?
  type: choose_one
  hint: Eukaryotic cells have there DNA enclosed by a membrane.
  explanation: Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus surrounded by a nuclear envelope that consists of two lipid membranes. The nucleus holds the eukaryotic cell's DNA. Mitochondria are an other cell compartment enclosed by a lipid membrane of eukaryotic cells. It is holding its own DNA the mitogenome. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus; rather, they have a membrane less nucleoside region (open part of the cell) that holds free-floating DNA.

# 2
- title: How is DNA also called?
  type: choose_one
  hint: DNA is a shortcut for? Our DNA contains all information we need to live. 
  explanation: DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and it includes instructions needed for an organism to grow, develop, live, and reproduce. Therefore, it is also known as the blueprint of life.

  choices:
    - 1: deoxyribonucleic acid
      correct: true
    - 2: blueprint of life
      correct: true
    - 3: Ribonucleic acid
      correct: false
    - 4: chromosome
      correct: false
    - 5: gene
      correct: false

# 3
- title: Mutations are always bad. Is this statement true or false?
  type: choose_one
  hint: How do species evolve over time?
  explanation: A mutation could lead to a better adjustment to a certain condition, like hot weather.

  choices:
    - 1: TRUE
      correct: false
    - 2: FALSE
      correct: true

# 4
- title: Mutations are insignificant for evolution. Is this statement true or false?
  type: choose_one
  hint: What is needed for an organism to change?
  explanation: Mutations are essential for evolution; they ensure genetic variation.

  point: 2
  choices:
    - 1: TRUE
      correct: false
    - 2: FALSE
      correct: true

# 5
- title: Mutations can help the next generations to adapt for hot climate.
  type: choose_one
  hint: There are genes encoding skin pigmentation. 
  explanation: A mutation could lead to a better adjustment to a certain condition, like hot weather.

    - 1: TRUE
      correct: true
    - 2: FALSE
      correct: false

# 6
- title: What are the bases of DNA?
  type: choose_many
  hint: The shortcuts for each Base are used to describe the genetic alphabet, e.g. {A,T,C,G} for DNA.
  explanation: Adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine are building blocks of DNA while in RNA there is uracil instead of thymine. A chromosome is a long DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Protein is a gene product resulting from expression of a gene.

      correct: true
    - 2: thymine
      correct: true
    - 3: protein
      correct: false
    - 4: chromosome
      correct: false
    - 5: cytisine
      correct: true
    - 6: uracile
      correct: false
    - 7: guanine
      correct: true

# 7
- title: How is the genetic information packaged within a cell?
  type: choose_one
  hint: The DNA should take very little space, but parts should be easily accessible.
  explanation: In a eucaryotic cell genetic material is tightly packaged into chromosomes.

  point: 3
  choices:
    - 1: It is cut into very small pieces.
      correct: false
    - 2: It is rolled up very tightly.
      correct: true
    - 3: It is folded into a specific shape.
      correct: false

# 8
- title: Do tomatoes contain DNA? Humans contain DNA - monkeys, dogs, and other animals too. What about the vegetables we eat?
  type: choose_one
  hint: DNA is an essential part of any life. 
  explanation: Plants are living organisms, and fruits and vegetables are also made up of living cells. Almost all cells contain DNA. There are only a few cells that do not contain any genetic information (for example, in humans, these are red blood cells).

  point: 3
  choices:
    - 1: No, fruits and vegetables do not contain DNA.
      correct: false
    - 2: Yes, tomatoes are made up of cells that contain DNA.
      correct: true
    - 3: No, only the plant on which the tomato ripens contains DNA.
      correct: false

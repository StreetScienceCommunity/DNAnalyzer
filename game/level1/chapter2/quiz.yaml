questions:

# 1
- title: Where is DNA contained in eukaryotic cells?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus surrounded by a nuclear envelope that consists of two lipid membranes. The nucleus holds the eukaryotic cell's DNA. Mitochondria are an other cell compartment enclosed by a lipid membrane of eukaryotic cells. It is holding its own DNA the mitogenome. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus; rather, they have a membrane less nucleoside region (open part of the cell) that holds free-floating DNA.

      correct: true

# 2
- title: How DNA also can be called?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and it includes instructions needed for an organism to grow, develop, live, and reproduce. Therefore, it is also known as the blueprint of life.

# 6
- title: What are the bases of DNA?
  type: choose many
  hint:
  explanation: Adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine are building blocks of DNA while in RNA there is uracil instead of thymine. A chromosome is a long DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Protein is a gene product resulting from expression of a gene.

# 7
- title: How does a cell pack its genetic information?
  type: choose one

  choices:
    - 1: The cell cuts them into very small pieces.
      correct: false
    - 2: The cell rolls them very tightly.
      correct: true
    - 3: The cell he folds them up.
      correct: false

# 8
- title: Do tomatoes contain DNA? Humans contain DNA - monkeys, dogs, and other animals too. What about the vegetables we eat?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Plants are living organisms, and fruits and vegetables are also made up of living cells. Almost all cells contain DNA. There are only a few cells that do not contain any genetic information (for example, in humans, these are red blood cells).

  choices:
    - 1: No, cells in fruits and vegetables do not contain DNA.
      correct: false
    - 2: Yes, tomatoes are made up of cells that contain DNA.
      correct: true
    - 3: No, only the plant on which the tomato ripens contains DNA.
      correct: false

  type: grid / grid checkbox
  hint: Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason.
  explanation: Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. Therefore, mutations can be bad for the individual but overall beneficial for a population. Niche properties like the color changing of lizards can be crucial for there survival. They are not as easy to find by animals who would like to eat them and therefore can survive longer than other species.

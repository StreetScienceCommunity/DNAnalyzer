# 1
- title: What is the proper definition of evolution?
  type: choose one
  hint: Even though evolution is taking place all around us, for many species the process operates so slowly that it is not observable except over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, much too long to witness in a human lifetime.
  explanation: Evolution is a change in a population of organisms through time leading to the appearance of new forms

  choices:
    - 1: changes in a population of organisms over a period of time
      correct: true
    - 2: changes in individual organisms during their lifetime
      correct: false
    - 3: organisms coming into existence at a defined moment in time and not changing
      correct: false

# 2
- title: What are biological survival benefits for a population?
  type: choose one
  hint: Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason. 
  explanation: Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. Therefore, mutations can be bad for the individual but overall beneficial for a population. Niche properties like the color changing of lizards can be crucial for there survival. They are not as easy to find by animals who would like to eat them and therefore can survive longer than other species.

# 3
- title: This salamander did not use its eyes so it lost its vision. Who said if you don't use it you lose it?
  type: choose one
  hint: Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.On the other hand, Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.
  explanation: The Lamarck's idea is organisms gaining abilities if they need them and losing others if they don't need them.

# 4
- title: How did Lamarck's theory of evolution differ from Darwin's?
  type: choose one
  hint: Darwin thought, that environment performs the cruel but immensely important task of selecting the fittest organisms.
  explanation: For Lamarck, the environment governs adaptive change by inheritance of acquired traits, while in Darwin thought, it performs the cruel but immensely important task of selecting the fittest organisms.

  choices:
    - 1: Lamarck believed that characteristics acquired during an organism’s lifetime could be passed on to the next generation.
      correct: true
    - 2: Lamarck believed that Earth was old enough to provide a sufficient time scale for the process of evolution.
      correct: false
    - 3: Lamarck believed that the organisms of a population that have suvival benefits will produce more offsprings
      correct: false

- title: Lamarck’s ideas about evolution include the concept that differences among the traits of organisms arise as a result of
  type: choose one
  hint: Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.
  explanation: The Lamarck's idea about organisms gaining some abilities if they need them and losing others if they don't need them is applicable here.

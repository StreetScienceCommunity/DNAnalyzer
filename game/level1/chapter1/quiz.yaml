# 1
- title: What is the proper definition of evolution?
  type: choose_one
  hint: Even though evolution is taking place all around us, for many species the process operates so slowly that it is not observable except over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, much too long to witness in a human lifetime.
  explanation: Evolution is a change in a population of organisms through time leading to the appearance of new forms

  point: 4
  choices:
    - 1: changes in a population of organisms over a period of time
      correct: true
    - 2: changes in individual organisms during their lifetime
      correct: false
    - 3: organisms coming into existence at a defined moment in time and not changing
      correct: false

# 2
- title: What are biological survival benefits for a population?
  type: choose_one
  hint: Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason. 
  explanation: Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. Therefore, mutations can be bad for the individual but overall beneficial for a population. Niche properties like the color changing of lizards can be crucial for there survival. They are not as easy to find by animals who would like to eat them and therefore can survive longer than other species.

      correct: true

# 3
- title: This salamander did not use its eyes so it lost its vision. Who said if you don't use it you lose it?
  type: choose_one
  hint: Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.On the other hand, Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.
  explanation: The Lamarck's idea is organisms gaining abilities if they need them and losing others if they don't need them.

    - 1: Malthus
      correct: false
    - 2: Lamarck
      correct: true
    - 3: Darwin
      correct: false

# 4
- title: How did Lamarck's theory of evolution differ from Darwin's?
  type: choose_one
  hint: Darwin thought, that environment performs the cruel but immensely important task of selecting the fittest organisms.
  explanation: For Lamarck, the environment governs adaptive change by inheritance of acquired traits, while in Darwin thought, it performs the cruel but immensely important task of selecting the fittest organisms.

  point: 3
  choices:
    - 1: Lamarck believed that characteristics acquired during an organism’s lifetime could be passed on to the next generation.
      correct: true
    - 2: Lamarck believed that Earth was old enough to provide a sufficient time scale for the process of evolution.
      correct: false
    - 3: Lamarck believed that the organisms of a population that have suvival benefits will produce more offsprings
      correct: false

# 5
- title: Lamarck’s ideas about evolution include the concept that differences among the traits of organisms arise as a result of
  type: choose_one
  hint: Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.
  explanation: The Lamarck's idea about organisms gaining some abilities if they need them and losing others if they don't need them is applicable here.

  choices:
    - 1: continual increases in population size.
      correct: false
    - 2: the actions of organisms as they use or fail to use body structures.
      correct: true
    - 3: an unchanging local environment.
      correct: false
    - 4: the natural variations already present within the population of organisms.
      correct: false

# 6
- title: What do humans and bananas have in common?
  type: choose_many
  hint:
  explanation: All living things evolved from a common ancestor. Therefore, humans, animals and other organisms share many of the same genes, and the molecules made from them function in similar ways. For example, the human and mouse genomes are about 85 percent the same.
  image_name:
  point: 4
  choices:
    - 1: genome
      correct: false
    - 2: part of their genomes
      correct: true
    - 3: distant ancestor
      correct: true
    - 4: some amount of genes
      correct: true

# 7
- title: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/labs//lab/evolution/research#/chooser - here you can play and learn. In this game, you'll climb around the tree of life, building out parts of it to better understand how evolution works. You'll be organising the collection of species into a tree. Build a tree by drugging species icons and then traits into the center of the screen. The split point represents the evolutionary moment when the common ancestor of these species diverged into two specific species. Click the button "Play" under the "Mission 1 - Training trees". And then, click “Play” again under “Red, green, and gecko”. Come back here and choose common traits of gecko and fungus.

# 8
- title: Choose non-hereditary traits
  type: choose_many
  hint:
  explanation: Genetic relations among languages are not biologically based, but are defined by cultural transmission from generation to generation. That is, languages are learned, not inherited via the genes. The fingerprint of identical twins (same set of chromosomes) is different and not inherited genetically.

- title: Sort these things in order from smallest (Size 1) to largest (Size 7).
  type: grid
  hint: Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason. 
  explanation: Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. Therefore, mutations can be bad for the individual but overall beneficial for a population. Niche properties like the color changing of lizards can be crucial for there survival. They are not as easy to find by animals who would like to eat them and therefore can survive longer than other species.

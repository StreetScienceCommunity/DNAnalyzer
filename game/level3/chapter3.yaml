- title: What is the other name of Sanger sequencing?
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Sanger DNA sequencing is also known as the chain-termination method of sequencing. The Sanger technique uses dideoxynucleotides or ddNTPs in addition to typical deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) in the reaction. ddNTPs result in termination of the DNA strand because ddNTPs lack the 3’-OH group required for phosphodiester bond formation between nucleotides. Without this bond, the chain of nucleotides being formed is terminated.

- title: Nanopore sequencing method was developed by
  type: choose one
  hint:
  explanation: Chain termination method was developed by Sanger, that is why it is also called Sanger sequencing method. In the same year, another chemical method of DNA sequencing was explained by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert. In 2014 the company Oxford Nanopore released its first portable nanopore sequencing device.

  hint: Change in an organism's environment forces the organism to adapt to fit the new environment, eventually causing it to evolve into a new species. But it might be just one of conditions for evolution, not the biological reason.
  explanation: Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. Therefore, mutations can be bad for the individual but overall beneficial for a population. Niche properties like the color changing of lizards can be crucial for there survival. They are not as easy to find by animals who would like to eat them and therefore can survive longer than other species.

- Thanks to nanopore sequencing, I receive the unique sequence of DNA.
- But what is next to do with this sequence? 
- How to determine the specific organism this DNA belongs to?

- The answer is to compare this sequence with the so-called reference sequence. 
- It is the sequence which serves as a template.

### Alignment

Second letter of both sequences are in red frame and marked as "Mismatch". Last letters of both sequences are in blue frame and marked as "Gap".](images/paiwise-alignment.png)

- I can compare sequences by alignment. 
- Sequence alignment is an arrangement of two or more sequences, highlighting their similarity.
- Comparing the sequences it could be that one of the sequences has a different nucleotide in one position. 
- This is called a Mismatch like the C to T in the red box.
- It could also happen that there is no nucleotide in the second sequence to the one in the first like the G in the blue box. This is called a gap.
- Mismatches in the alignment correspond to mutations, and gaps correspond to insertions or deletions.

- Alignment is an important instrument for finding a similarity between two or more sequences
- Due to its semi-conservative duplication mechanism, DNA transmits genetic information from generation to generation. 
- Changes in the material are sometimes caused by errors or mutations in duplication, or by viruses and other mechanisms that move sequences between individuals and within chromosomes. 
- Alignment between sequences indicates that both sequences originated from a common ancestor that contained the matching subsequences. 
- In the case of genetic sequences, it implies that their carriers evolved from a common ancestor.

### Metagenomics

- Now I know enough to work with samples of different creatures. 
- Since I am on earth, I can collect a variety of samples and analyze them. 
- Nevertheless, they are all inextricably linked to their surroundings. 
- A clear sample of one organism is impossible to obtain.
- It looks like a meta genome.
- Luckily there is a solution because there is something called metagenomics. 
- The metagenomics is the type of genetic analyses focused on DNA samples extracted from the environment.

### Metagenomics

![Metagenimics process is presented. There are four pictures: space, soil, water, tissues. From all four pictures there are arrows to the test tubes. Then the arrow leads to the table describing the samples. Next, to the DNA picture. Then, to the sequencing machine. Then, to the computer.](images/metagenomics2.png)

- There are several steps in the metagenomics process, including collecting samples, DNA sequencing, assembly, classifying, annotation, and analysis.
- As you can see in the picture, it is possible to collect samples from different environments - soil, water, the human gut, and even from another planet, such as Sam's planet.
- The samples are sent to a laboratory for DNA extraction and sequencing.
- After obtaining these sequences they can be processed using various technical tools. 
- The sequences are identified by assembling, classifying and annotating them. 
- Afterwards they can be further analyzed.

### Metagenomics

- Places like soil, air, water, parts of living organisms, and other places can be used as sources of samples.
- Once samples are collected, the second step is DNA sequencing. In this step, short DNA reads will be prepared.

### Metagenomics

???
- Starting from this short DNA reads a metagenomics analysis can be performed. 
- The first step is assembly, in which short reads are made longer by using different assembly algorithms. 
- This longer sequence is called “contigs”.

???
- Classifying (or binning) is the second step. 
- Each contig can be assigned to the most appropriate genome.
- At the third step, the so called annotation, the data from the previous steps will be used to annotate.
- Genes can be predicted. 
- Species can be identified.

???
- Once the first three steps of metagenomics are completed the resulting data can be analyzed. 
- The experts use different tools to analyze data and draw conclusions to answer their research questions.
- I want to learn more about existing metagenomic analysis tools and I also want to analyze the data.
- It is fascinating what different colorful graphs that visually reflect information about the data I can see.
- Would you also want to analyze metagenome data?
